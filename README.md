A simple app to search random users

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
DEMO: https://

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `yarn dev`: Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
- `yarn test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode
- `yarn build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## APIs

- For the get users and API search, I'm used [Kiwi](https://randomuser.me/api/)

## FAQ

- **Why Typescript?** I believe that using a static analysis tool like Typescript can boost developer's productivity. It at least prevents developers from making stupid mistakes like using/passing the wrong data types, forgetting the possibility of a data type containing `undefined` or `null`, and many other stuff. It can become some sort of in-code documentation as well.
